        We are a toy swapping website for local communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toys can be expensive and children become easily bored of playing with them leaving you with rooms full of pretty new unloved toys.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Swaps R Us you can upload your lonely toys and let others borrow them and you can pick some to borrow too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact the lender and arrange a local pick-up. Swap and enjoy and then when you are bored - swap again!
      </p>
      <p>
        Browse and upload your toys below.
